## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines what our Tour Planning and Recommendation System should do. Think of it as a blueprint for building a smart travel app that helps people discover places, plan trips, and get personalized suggestions.

### 1.2 Scope
Our system is a web app that does several cool things:
- Lets users sign up and manage their profiles
- Suggests places they might like based on their preferences
- Helps them plan trips with optimized routes
- Shows interactive maps with all the places
- Lets them save and share their travel plans

### 1.3 Definitions and Acronyms
- **SRS**: Software Requirements Specification (this document)
- **API**: Application Programming Interface (how different parts talk to each other)
- **JWT**: JSON Web Token (a secure way to remember who's logged in)
- **MERN**: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js (the tech stack we're using)
- **TSP**: Traveling Salesman Problem (finding the best route between multiple places)
- **CF**: Collaborative Filtering (how we suggest places based on what similar users like)

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 System Purpose
We're building this system to make travel planning easier and more fun. Instead of spending hours researching places and figuring out routes, users can get smart recommendations and optimized itineraries. We're focusing on Indian tourist destinations, but the system can work anywhere.

### 2.2 System Context
Our app works like this:
- **Frontend**: A React.js website that users interact with
- **Backend**: A Node.js server that handles all the business logic
- **Database**: MongoDB to store user data, places, and travel plans
- **External Services**: Google Maps and Places APIs for location data

### 2.3 System Functions
The main things our system does:
1. User registration and login
2. Finding and searching for places
3. Giving personalized recommendations
4. Planning and optimizing travel routes
5. Showing routes on interactive maps
6. Managing saved trips and history
